The first-principle problem

The problem is not that enterprises lack security controls.

The problem is that enterprise security controls are not structurally integrated, and therefore cannot consistently express or enforce trust.

Most enterprises already have:

network segmentation

application authentication

RBAC (of some kind)

firewalls / proxies / WAFs

logging / SIEM

Yet the exposure problem persists because these controls answer different questions, at different layers, with different owners, and they rarely share a single source of truth.

So the first-principle failure is:

Trust is being enforced through static adjacency and fragmented controls, not governed through an integrated trust model.

The philosophical conditions that make ZTNA hard in enterprises

ZTNA (brokerage-style) is a correct aspiration, but it presupposes conditions that many enterprises do not have.

ZTNA works best when applications are:

identity-native
The app (or a workload-side agent) can interpret identity context as a first-class input to authorization.

transaction-aware
Authorization is not “can you connect,” but “can you perform this operation right now, under this context.”

instrumented
Telemetry exists at the correct layer: requests, methods, objects, data classes, session state, anomalies.

governed by lifecycle discipline
Ownership, documentation, and decommissioning are real—not tribal.

Enterprises are rarely this uniform. They’re mixtures of:

legacy monoliths

partially modernized apps

vendor products with limited authZ models

“works fine” workloads with weak observability

multiple parallel delivery stacks (Akamai → WAFs → ALBs/NLBs → F5, plus internal-only F5, plus multiple SFTP patterns, plus SaaS, plus Citrix/VDI)

So the condition is:

ZTNA assumes the world is coherent. Enterprises are not coherent.

ZTNA as ideology says: “move policy to identity.”
Enterprise reality says: “identity exists, but the workloads don’t know how to use it.”

The core enterprise challenge ZTNA doesn’t solve by itself

ZTNA brokerage can mediate who gets a connection, but it does not automatically solve:

ambiguous ownership (who is accountable?)

missing documentation and business justification

inconsistent service patterns

lack of transaction semantics in legacy apps

lack of uniform telemetry and anomaly detection

inability to isolate suspicious sessions safely

operational chaos from bespoke one-off implementations

The false promise leadership often hears is:

“We validate every transaction.”

But the hard question is:

“Validate what, using which signals, against which behavioral baseline, and isolate how without breaking the business?”

Without workload-native context, “transaction validation” collapses into shallow checks:

user identity + device posture + generic risk score
Helpful, but nowhere near “BeyondCorp-grade transaction enforcement.”

Why enterprises end up with “brokerage + hope”

Because brokerage is consumable.

It is easier to buy than to redesign apps.

It produces visible progress.

It sounds like governance (identity policies) even when the underlying transaction layer is opaque.

It reduces some risk, but not the risk leaders actually care about once you shine a light on third-party interactions.

And because enterprises struggle with:

culture change

ownership models

lifecycle planning

estimating cost of modernization

pausing business to re-architect (“can’t change tires at 100 mph”)

So they choose solutions that don’t force them to confront the full truth.

The “BeyondCorp gap” in one sentence

BeyondCorp-style maturity depends on workload capability.

Most enterprises want BeyondCorp outcomes but have BeyondCorp-incompatible workloads.

So the gap is:

The enterprise wants identity-driven, transaction-aware control, but the applications cannot consistently express or enforce it.

What RC1 is, philosophically

RC1 is not “a ZTNA product.”
RC1 is a governance + mediation machine that overlays modern control-plane structure onto legacy application estates.

It represents a midpoint because it delivers the operational primitives that modern identity-native environments assume—without requiring the apps to be rewritten.

It does this by shifting the enforcement plane:

from network adjacency to governed service mediation

from implicit trust to explicit trust domains (tenant-scoped)

from coarse allow/deny to proxy-mediated inspection and containment

So RC1 is the bridge between:

legacy enterprise reality

and modern trust-model aspirations

RC1 as midpoint: mapping modern BeyondCorp properties onto legacy

Here’s the direct mapping you asked for.

1) BeyondCorp property: strong identity as trust primitive

Legacy reality: identity is inside the app (if at all), not at the network boundary.

RC1 midpoint:
Identity is overlaid at the mediation layer:

mTLS user certs for session attribution

service instance certs for proxy identity

tenant sub-CA for tenant trust domain identity

This doesn’t magically modernize the app, but it ensures:

“No meaningful session exists without identity binding.”

2) BeyondCorp property: context-driven policy enforcement

Legacy reality: context signals are inconsistent, and apps don’t consume them.

RC1 midpoint:
Context is enforced through:

tenant scoping (trust boundary)

service patterns (known exposure shapes)

proxy policy (destination ACLs, service allowlists, protocol constraints)

inspection tiers and anomaly hooks

You’re not enforcing “business-object authorization,” but you are enforcing:

“Access only exists through a governed pattern with measurable behavior.”

3) BeyondCorp property: per-request / per-transaction evaluation

Legacy reality: most legacy apps can’t express a transaction model externally.

RC1 midpoint:
Transactions are evaluated at the proxy through:

decrypted traffic inspection

behavioral telemetry

protocol-aware checks

thresholds, out-of-spec detection

routing to isolation/sandbox when required

This is critical: it provides a transaction surrogate when the app cannot.

4) BeyondCorp property: least privilege and segmentation

Legacy reality: segmentation is static and becomes brittle.

RC1 midpoint:
Segmentation becomes:

tenant VRF isolation

tenant DNS namespace controls

tenant-scoped proxy identities and policies

governed service catalog

This is least privilege by structure, not by endless firewall exceptions.

5) BeyondCorp property: centralized visibility + continuous monitoring

Legacy reality: visibility is fragmented by delivery pattern.

RC1 midpoint:
Visibility is normalized at the mediation layer:

every flow traverses known enforcement points

telemetry is consistent across service patterns

session identity allows audit and anomaly tracing

6) BeyondCorp property: governance maturity

Legacy reality: no structured ownership, justification, risk analysis, or lifecycle.

RC1 midpoint:
Governance becomes an enforceable workflow:

AppID-owned exposure assets

SNOW approval boundary

portal as source of truth

service patterns instead of bespoke

identity-bound execution controls (sudo/groups)

lifecycle states and cryptographic retirement

This is where RC1 is transformative:

It doesn’t just secure traffic. It forces the organization to become governable.

Why RC1 is not “a stop-gap” in practice

Even if leadership aspires to modernize applications, most enterprises will not uniformly rebuild their workload estate.

So RC1 becomes a durable operating model because it provides:

a consistent exposure framework

a scalable governance mechanism

an enforcement substrate for inspection/containment

a way to impose structure on heterogeneous services

It’s “0 → 80%” because it brings:

identity overlay

consistent enforcement points

governance workflow discipline

isolation capability

…without requiring every application team to become a BeyondCorp engineering team.

The deep truth RC1 embodies

ZTNA brokerage answers:

“Who can connect to what?”

RC1/EGP answers:

“How do we govern, inspect, attribute, and contain exposure in a world where applications cannot do it themselves?”

That’s why RC1 exists.
It’s the midpoint between aspiration and reality.
