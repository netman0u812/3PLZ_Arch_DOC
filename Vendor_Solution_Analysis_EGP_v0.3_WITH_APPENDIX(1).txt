VENDOR SOLUTION ANALYSIS (v0.2) Paradigm-First Mapping to the Exposure
Governance Plane

Executive Summary

This document evaluates vendor responses through the architectural lens
established in the Exposure Governance Plane paper. The purpose is not
to score feature lists, but to determine structural alignment between
vendor paradigms and the enterprise’s dominant risk domains.

Third-party access is not only an access-control problem. In
heterogeneous enterprises, it is primarily a governance and
service-exposure problem: ownership, lifecycle, evidence, protocol
mediation, transactional assurance, and containment.

Vendor offerings in this space are coherent within distinct enforcement
paradigms:

-   Network Enforcement
-   Edge Abstraction
-   Identity Brokerage
-   Service Augmentation (Mediation)

The enterprise must choose the paradigm that compresses its dominant
risks before selecting a product.

======================================================================

1.  The Evaluation Lens: Why Paradigms Matter

Most RFP processes implicitly assume vendors are interchangeable “ZTNA”
solutions differentiated by features. The responses demonstrate
otherwise.

Each vendor encodes a philosophy about where enforcement belongs:

-   At the network boundary (segmentation)
-   At the global edge (abstraction)
-   At an identity broker (session mediation)
-   At a service mediation layer (augmentation)

These paradigms optimize different risk dimensions. Feature comparisons
without paradigm clarity produce false equivalence.

======================================================================

2.  Enterprise Substrate Reality: Why Brokerage Alone Is Insufficient

Large enterprises rarely present a uniform application architecture.
Instead, they operate mixed estates:

-   Multiple SFTP implementations
-   Multiple WAF and load-balancing stacks
-   Mixed cloud-native and on-prem patterns
-   SaaS and internally hosted collaboration
-   VDI/Citrix coexistence
-   Internal-to-third-party workload flows

In such environments, third-party exposure cannot be treated as a single
connectivity pattern. Each tenant exposure must be defined as a bespoke
service instance governed through standard patterns.

This is why the portal and workflow model is not a convenience feature.
It is the control plane that makes heterogeneity governable.

======================================================================

3.  Transaction Validation and the CISO Containment Requirement

Leadership expectations often include “validate every transaction” and
“isolate out-of-spec sessions.” These requirements exceed session
authorization alone.

Transactional validation requires:

-   Protocol termination where inspection is needed
-   Semantic understanding of protocol behavior
-   Identity continuity across actions
-   Behavioral baselining
-   Runtime containment mechanisms

Containment is not binary deny/allow. It is a ladder:

1.  Alert and log
2.  Rate limit
3.  Session termination
4.  Redirect to inspection pool
5.  Tenant quarantine

Solutions must be evaluated on whether they can operationalize this, not
merely authorize session establishment.

======================================================================

4.  Vendor Paradigm Mapping

4.1 Cisco — Network Enforcement + Managed Integration

Cisco’s response aligns most strongly with network enforcement and
segmentation, augmented by identity signals and often delivered with
managed service capability.

Strengths: - Deterministic adjacency control and blast-radius
reduction - Strong enterprise routing/control-plane integration -
Operational maturity through managed delivery options

Limitations: - Network enforcement does not inherently mediate protocol
semantics - Transaction validation depth depends on additional layers -
Governance workflow remains an enterprise responsibility

Cisco compresses adjacency and unauthorized access risk effectively, but
unsafe service exposure risk requires augmentation beyond pure network
controls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 Cloudflare — Edge Abstraction Model

Cloudflare represents a global edge abstraction philosophy: enforcement
is shifted outward to a distributed edge fabric.

Strengths: - Consolidated Internet-facing ingress and policy
enforcement - Strong HTTP/API edge inspection capabilities - Scalable
edge identity integration

Limitations: - Protocol diversity and internal locality nuance require
adaptation - Internal heterogeneity persists behind the edge - Deep
containment beyond edge policy requires additional design

Cloudflare compresses perimeter complexity effectively where services
are edge-compatible, but does not inherently normalize enterprise
service diversity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3 Zscaler — Identity Brokerage Model

Zscaler aligns with the brokerage paradigm: identity mediates session
establishment, reducing implicit network trust.

Strengths: - Strong user-to-application identity mediation - Centralized
policy model and clear ZTNA narrative - Reduction of static VPN
dependence

Limitations: - Brokerage validates session start, not necessarily
in-session semantics - Deep transaction inspection requires termination
placement - Assumes higher application maturity for full promise -
Governance workflow remains enterprise responsibility

Zscaler compresses unauthorized session establishment risk strongly, but
unsafe service exposure and containment require mediation layers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.4 F5 — Augmentation and Service Mediation

F5 aligns most closely with augmentation: inserting mediation at the
service boundary to normalize protocols, inject missing controls, and
enable inspection.

Strengths: - Deep protocol termination and inspection flexibility -
Tunable mediation placement (cloud/on-prem) - Strong alignment with
heterogeneous service stacks - Structural support for containment
pathways

Limitations: - Requires architectural discipline and operational
maturity - Governance workflow must still be built or integrated

F5 compresses unsafe service exposure risk most directly and aligns
strongly with the Exposure Governance Plane model when designed
correctly.

======================================================================

5.  Governance and Integration Reality

None of the evaluated vendors deliver a complete Exposure Governance
Plane as a turnkey service. All provide enforcement substrates.

The dominant cost driver is integration and workflow design:

-   Pattern standardization
-   Portal UX and intake governance
-   Identity lifecycle maturity
-   Telemetry normalization
-   Containment policy tuning

Managed service options exist more clearly in some paradigms, but
governance ownership cannot be outsourced entirely. The enterprise must
define the unit of control: the Service Exposure Instance.

======================================================================

6.  Problem vs Vendor Coverage Matrix (Paradigm View)

Risk / Requirement Cisco Cloudflare Zscaler F5

Adjacency control Strong Moderate Weak Moderate Unauthorized session
prevention Moderate Strong Strong Strong Protocol mediation depth Weak
Moderate Weak Strong Transactional validation Weak Moderate Weak Strong
Containment / isolation realism Moderate Moderate Weak Strong
Heterogeneous service fit Moderate Moderate Moderate Strong Governance
workflow provided Partial Partial Partial Partial Integration burden
High High High High

Key takeaway: The differentiator is not access brokerage. The
differentiator is mediation depth and containment realism in
heterogeneous application environments.

======================================================================

7.  Synthesis

There is no universally “best” vendor. Each is coherent within its
paradigm.

The enterprise must first decide which risk domain dominates:

-   If adjacency risk dominates → network enforcement strong.
-   If perimeter complexity dominates → edge abstraction strong.
-   If implicit trust dominates → brokerage strong.
-   If unsafe service behavior dominates → augmentation strong.

Given heterogeneous substrate conditions and explicit containment
expectations, augmentation-aligned architectures most closely match the
Exposure Governance Plane model.

Vendor selection should follow paradigm alignment — not precede it.



APPENDIX — RC1 ADMIN PORTAL & GATEWAY REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE
Evidence-Based Evaluation Frame for Vendor Paradigms (v0.2 POLISHED)

======================================================================

Purpose

This appendix documents the RC1 Gateway and Administrative Portal design
because it is not merely an implementation artifact — it is the proof-of-
implementability reference model that makes vendor evaluation possible.

The enterprise’s initial request was framed as a product selection problem:
“find us a solution we can buy to fix third-party access.”

RC1 demonstrated a more fundamental truth:

Third-party exposure is not solved by connectivity alone.
It is solved by governed service mediation: identity binding, protocol-aware
inspection, containment, lifecycle control, and evidence generation.

Without an operational reference model, vendor claims cannot be evaluated
credibly, scoping cannot be grounded, and integration cost cannot be estimated.

RC1 therefore provides the structural frame against which all vendor paradigms
must be measured.

======================================================================

1. RC1 Gateway Horizontal Scaling Model

The RC1 data plane is a horizontally scalable Gateway (GW) cluster.
Capacity is increased by adding nodes, not redesigning architecture.

Each node has two interfaces:

- eth0 (Public / Default VRF):
  Terminates tenant-facing IPsec connectivity.

- eth1 (Internal / Service-side):
  Routes mediated proxy traffic toward enterprise application domains.

Tenants terminate on routed loopback VIPs:

- Each tenant is assigned a unique loopback address from a shared block.
- Loopbacks exist on all nodes, with one node selected as primary.
- OSPF dynamically advertises the active tenant VIP upstream.

This enables:

- deterministic reachability
- horizontal scaling
- failover without readdressing

======================================================================

2. Tenant Isolation via VRF/VLAN/VXLAN Overlays

Each tenant is provisioned as a fully isolated logical segment:

- Tenant IP block
- Unique VRF name
- Unique VLAN ID
- Unique VXLAN ID

All gateway nodes participate in the tenant overlay,
enabling multi-node service delivery while preserving isolation.

======================================================================

3. Portal as Governance Control Plane (Source of Truth)

The administrative portal is not “UI.”
It is the control plane that makes governance operable.

Provisioning is executed through strict separation of duties:

- net_alloc (Allocation Authority):
  Assigns scarce shared resources:
  loopbacks, IP blocks, VRFs, VLANs, VXLAN IDs, proxy VIPs, egress IPs.

- net-imp (Implementation Authority):
  Applies infrastructure state:
  tunnels, routing, overlays, enforcement chains.

This model enables:

- deterministic automation
- audit replayability
- refusal authority through workflow gates
- lifecycle enforcement through portal governance

======================================================================

4. Why RC1 Was Required

RC1 was not discretionary.
It answered three critical enterprise questions:

1. Can the theory be implemented?
2. What does “self-service governance” actually require?
3. What is the real integration cost driver?

RC1 proved that the dominant cost is workflow, not licensing.
It also established the “Service Exposure Instance” as the unit of control,
not the tunnel or firewall rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Enforcement    Cisco            AC-4 (Info Flow Enforcement),
                                      SC-7 (Boundary Protection),
                                      Segmentation & adjacency reduction

                                      Reduced implicit trust

Service Augmentation   F5               SC-8/SC-13 (Transmission Protection),
                                      AU-2/AU-12 (Audit Evidence),
                                      Protocol mediation + containment,
                                      Transaction validation overlays

Key takeaway:

Brokerage compresses unauthorized session establishment risk.
Augmentation compresses unsafe service exposure risk.

The Exposure Governance Plane requires both governance workflow and
mediation depth, especially in heterogeneous application estates.
