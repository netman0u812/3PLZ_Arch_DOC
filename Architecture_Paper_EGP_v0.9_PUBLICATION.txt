I. THE PROBLEM IS NOT CONNECTIVITY
======================================================================

Modern enterprises are not constrained by bandwidth, routing, or encryption.
They are constrained by unmanaged trust relationships.

Over decades, organizations have accumulated thousands of external connections:
partners, vendors, SaaS providers, APIs, file exchanges, administrative tunnels.
Each was justified. Few were retired. Almost none were re-validated structurally.

The failure pattern is consistent:
- Network segmentation exists.
- Application authentication exists.
- RBAC models exist.
- Logging exists.

But they are not integrated.

They rely on static overlays — VLANs, firewall rules, ACLs — to enforce policy
without understanding identity context or transactional behavior.

Zero Trust argued that identity should replace network adjacency as the primary trust boundary.
That insight remains correct.

However, most enterprise applications were not built for contextual,
transaction-level authorization. They were built to function — not to express
identity-rich policy logic.

The Exposure Governance Plane (EGP) bridges that gap.

======================================================================
II. FOUR ENFORCEMENT PARADIGMS
======================================================================

Enterprise solutions for third-party access fall into four philosophical models:

1. Network Enforcement
2. Abstraction (Edge Consolidation)
3. Brokerage (ZTNA Mediation)
4. Augmentation (Identity + Inspection Overlay)

Each reflects assumptions about application maturity.

EGP aligns with Augmentation — not as ideology, but as necessity.

======================================================================
III. TENANT AS THE NEW BOUNDARY
======================================================================

Traditional segmentation isolates subnets.
EGP isolates trust domains.

Each tenant becomes:

- A governance object
- A PKI sub-authority
- A DNS namespace
- A proxy mediation boundary
- A telemetry scope
- A lifecycle-managed exposure unit

We no longer protect networks.
We govern exposure domains.

======================================================================
IV. IDENTITY LAYERS
======================================================================

Identity in EGP has three layers:

1. Tenant Identity (cryptographic boundary)
2. Service Identity (proxy instance certificate)
3. Session Identity (user/system attribution)

Separating these layers prevents brittle enforcement models.

======================================================================
V. EXECUTION DISCIPLINE
======================================================================

Automation must not collapse separation of duties.

EGP enforces identity-bound execution via sudo and group controls.

Authority is explicit.
Privilege is modular.
Audit is layered.

======================================================================
VI. PRACTICAL ZERO TRUST
======================================================================

EGP is a compromise between aspiration and reality.

It overlays structure onto imperfect systems.
It introduces inspection where none was integrated.
It enforces retirement cryptographically.

It replaces unmanaged adjacency with governed mediation.
