APPENDIX — RC1 ADMIN PORTAL + GW DESIGN FRAME

The RC1 implementation was not a discretionary build exercise; it was a proof-of-implementability.
The enterprise originally sought a product purchase to solve third-party access risk. However,
without a concrete operational model, vendor evaluation becomes speculative.

RC1 established a working control-plane and data-plane reference architecture:

- A horizontally scalable Gateway (GW) cluster forms the mediation fabric.
- Tenants terminate on routed loopback VIPs dynamically advertised via OSPF.
- Each tenant is isolated through VRF/VLAN/VXLAN overlays across all nodes.
- A portal serves as the governance control plane and source of truth.

Two operational roles enforce separation of duties:

- net_alloc: allocation authority (IP blocks, VRFs, VLANs, loopbacks, proxy VIPs)
- net-imp: implementation authority (instantiate tunnels, routing, overlays, enforcement)

RC1 therefore provides the evaluation frame for vendor offerings:
it defines what must exist operationally for any paradigm to be real.
