BUSINESS OUTCOME DECISION FRAMEWORK
Third-Party Landing Zone Initiative
Exposure Governance Plane Program
Version 1.1 – Full Narrative

======================================================================
1. Executive Context and Intent
======================================================================

The Third-Party Landing Zone initiative was framed around a specific and
measurable business objective: establish a structured, pattern-based,
self-service governed model for external-to-internal and internal-to-external
application connectivity. This objective includes identity-aware mediation,
decrypted inspection where required, transactional validation, and the ability
to detect, isolate, and remediate anomalous behavior.

This effort is not simply a modernization of connectivity. It is a structural
response to unmanaged exposure risk in a heterogeneous enterprise estate.
The decision before leadership is therefore not a product comparison.
It is an operating-model alignment decision.

All evaluated solution paradigms are viable.
Each advances different dimensions of the intended outcome.
Each compresses different risk domains.
Each presumes a different level of governance maturity.

======================================================================
2. The Enterprise Condition
======================================================================

Large enterprises rarely operate clean, uniform application environments.
Instead, they accumulate heterogeneous delivery models:

- Multiple SFTP patterns
- Mixed WAF and load-balancer stacks
- SaaS and legacy coexistence
- Internal-to-external bespoke data exchanges
- Firewall-centric adjacency enforcement

Over time, bespoke connectivity patterns multiply.
Ownership becomes diffuse.
Inspection becomes inconsistent.
Containment capability becomes limited.

Zero Trust principles provide an aspirational model — identity validation,
least privilege, contextual authorization. However, most enterprise
applications are not fully identity-native. They lack deep transaction-aware
controls. As a result, session establishment control alone does not
equate to transaction validation.

The Landing Zone initiative therefore seeks to overlay sufficient structure,
mediation, and governance to render exposure risk manageable without
requiring wholesale application re-architecture.

======================================================================
3. RC1 as Proof of Feasibility
======================================================================

RC1 was constructed as a proof-of-feasibility reference architecture.
It was not designed as a finished production solution.

RC1 validated:

- Technical feasibility of mediation and inspection placement
- Horizontal gateway scaling and tenant isolation
- Separation of duties between allocation and implementation
- Source-of-Truth governance abstraction

RC1 did not attempt to deliver:

- Full self-service business portal integration
- Enterprise-wide lifecycle workflow automation
- IAM maturity uplift

Its purpose was to ground vendor evaluation in implementable reality
rather than conceptual alignment.

======================================================================
4. Definition of the Intended Outcome
======================================================================

The intended outcome includes:

1. Pattern-based exposure (not bespoke one-offs)
2. Structured onboarding with ownership binding
3. Identity overlay where required for accountability
4. Decrypted inspection for high-risk flows
5. Transaction-level validation beyond session establishment
6. Runtime containment capability
7. Lifecycle and expiration enforcement
8. Governance workflow integration

This outcome definition forms the evaluation baseline.

======================================================================
5. Paradigm Analysis
======================================================================

A. Network Enforcement (Cisco-aligned)

Advances:
- Strong adjacency segmentation
- Blast-radius reduction
- Managed operational maturity

Presumes:
- Adjacency is the dominant risk
- Transaction validation can remain external

Residual Risk:
- Limited deep protocol mediation
- Containment requires additional layers

Signal:
Stabilization and incremental modernization.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Identity Brokerage (Zscaler-aligned)

Advances:
- Strong session establishment control
- Least-privilege enforcement
- Centralized identity policy

Presumes:
- Session control sufficiently reduces risk
- Applications tolerate brokered access

Residual Risk:
- Limited SSH/SFTP transaction inspection
- Containment depth requires augmentation

Signal:
Identity-first modernization strategy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Edge Abstraction (Cloudflare-aligned)

Advances:
- Unified ingress governance
- Strong HTTP/API inspection
- Perimeter simplification

Presumes:
- Edge consolidation materially reduces complexity
- Internal heterogeneity can remain behind edge

Residual Risk:
- Governance workflow still required
- Platform dependency introduced

Signal:
Strategic architectural repositioning.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Service Augmentation (F5 / EGP-aligned)

Advances:
- Protocol-aware mediation
- Transaction-level inspection
- Containment integration
- Heterogeneous estate compatibility

Presumes:
- Governance workflows will be engineered
- Engineering discipline is available

Residual Risk:
- Higher design responsibility
- Operational ownership required

Signal:
Structural exposure correction strategy.

======================================================================
6. Cost and Execution Considerations
======================================================================

Initial hypotheses considered dual-vendor MVP development through a common
portal abstraction. This approach introduces redundant integration effort,
time delay, and duplicative implementation logic.

Given that RC1 validated feasibility and defined governance abstractions,
vendor evaluation grounded in that reference reduces time-to-decision
and avoids non-transferable integration cost.

The dominant cost driver across all options is governance workflow and
integration engineering, not licensing.

======================================================================
7. Governance Dependencies
======================================================================

Regardless of vendor selection:

- Governance processes must be defined
- Ownership must be bound to each exposure
- Identity lifecycle maturity must advance
- Inspection policies must be explicit
- Portal integration must be engineered

No vendor eliminates governance responsibility.

======================================================================
8. Strategic Selection Guidance
======================================================================

If the objective is adjacency stabilization → Network Enforcement aligns best.

If the objective is accelerated identity modernization → Identity Brokerage
aligns best.

If the objective is perimeter repositioning → Edge Abstraction aligns best.

If the objective is structural mediation and containment across heterogeneous
applications → Service Augmentation aligned to the Exposure Governance Plane
advances that outcome most directly.

All options are viable. The distinction lies in transformation appetite,
residual risk tolerance, and governance maturity.

======================================================================
9. Synthesis
======================================================================

The enterprise is not choosing between vendors first.
It is choosing between enforcement philosophies.

The decision should reflect:

- Desired risk compression domain
- Organizational transformation capacity
- Governance maturity trajectory
- Time-to-risk-reduction requirements

Vendor selection should follow outcome alignment — not precede it.
