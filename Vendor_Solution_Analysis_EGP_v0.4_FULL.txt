VENDOR SOLUTION ANALYSIS (v0.4)
Exposure Governance Plane Lens — Outcome-Aligned Technical Findings

1. Decision Context (Technical Framing)

The Third-Party Landing Zone initiative defines a governed, pattern-based
service exposure objective: standardized onboarding of external-to-internal
application access and internal-to-external bespoke communications, supported
by identity-aware mediation, decrypted inspection where required, and
transaction-level containment pathways.

This document evaluates vendor responses against that operational outcome.
All evaluated approaches are viable. The differentiation lies in which
dimensions of the desired outcome each paradigm advances natively, which
require augmentation, and what governance maturity each presumes.

2. RC1 as Feasibility Reference Frame

RC1 was constructed as a proof-of-feasibility model, not a production platform.
It validates the technical functions and governance abstractions required for
any solution.

3. Paradigm Mapping of Vendor Responses

- Cisco: Network Enforcement
- Cloudflare: Edge Abstraction
- Zscaler: Identity Brokerage
- F5: Service Augmentation

All options require governance workflow integration. Selection should follow
outcome alignment.

VENDOR SOLUTION ANALYSIS (v0.2) Paradigm-First Mapping to the Exposure
Governance Plane

Executive Summary

This document evaluates vendor responses through the architectural lens
established in the Exposure Governance Plane paper. The purpose is not
to score feature lists, but to determine structural alignment between
vendor paradigms and the enterprise’s dominant risk domains.

Third-party access is not only an access-control problem. In
heterogeneous enterprises, it is primarily a governance and
service-exposure problem: ownership, lifecycle, evidence, protocol
mediation, transactional assurance, and containment.

Vendor offerings in this space are coherent within distinct enforcement
paradigms:

-   Network Enforcement
-   Edge Abstraction
-   Identity Brokerage
-   Service Augmentation (Mediation)

The enterprise must choose the paradigm that compresses its dominant
risks before selecting a product.

======================================================================

1.  The Evaluation Lens: Why Paradigms Matter

Most RFP processes implicitly assume vendors are interchangeable “ZTNA”
solutions differentiated by features. The responses demonstrate
otherwise.

Each vendor encodes a philosophy about where enforcement belongs:

-   At the network boundary (segmentation)
-   At the global edge (abstraction)
-   At an identity broker (session mediation)
-   At a service mediation layer (augmentation)

These paradigms optimize different risk dimensions. Feature comparisons
without paradigm clarity produce false equivalence.

======================================================================

2.  Enterprise Substrate Reality: Why Brokerage Alone Is Insufficient

Large enterprises rarely present a uniform application architecture.
Instead, they operate mixed estates:

-   Multiple SFTP implementations
-   Multiple WAF and load-balancing stacks
-   Mixed cloud-native and on-prem patterns
-   SaaS and internally hosted collaboration
-   VDI/Citrix coexistence
-   Internal-to-third-party workload flows

In such environments, third-party exposure cannot be treated as a single
connectivity pattern. Each tenant exposure must be defined as a bespoke
service instance governed through standard patterns.

This is why the portal and workflow model is not a convenience feature.
It is the control plane that makes heterogeneity governable.

======================================================================

3.  Transaction Validation and the CISO Containment Requirement

Leadership expectations often include “validate every transaction” and
“isolate out-of-spec sessions.” These requirements exceed session
authorization alone.

Transactional validation requires:

-   Protocol termination where inspection is needed
-   Semantic understanding of protocol behavior
-   Identity continuity across actions
-   Behavioral baselining
-   Runtime containment mechanisms

Containment is not binary deny/allow. It is a ladder:

1.  Alert and log
2.  Rate limit
3.  Session termination
4.  Redirect to inspection pool
5.  Tenant quarantine

Solutions must be evaluated on whether they can operationalize this, not
merely authorize session establishment.

======================================================================

4.  Vendor Paradigm Mapping

4.1 Cisco — Network Enforcement + Managed Integration

Cisco’s response aligns most strongly with network enforcement and
segmentation, augmented by identity signals and often delivered with
managed service capability.

Strengths: - Deterministic adjacency control and blast-radius
reduction - Strong enterprise routing/control-plane integration -
Operational maturity through managed delivery options

Limitations: - Network enforcement does not inherently mediate protocol
semantics - Transaction validation depth depends on additional layers -
Governance workflow remains an enterprise responsibility

Cisco compresses adjacency and unauthorized access risk effectively, but
unsafe service exposure risk requires augmentation beyond pure network
controls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 Cloudflare — Edge Abstraction Model

Cloudflare represents a global edge abstraction philosophy: enforcement
is shifted outward to a distributed edge fabric.

Strengths: - Consolidated Internet-facing ingress and policy
enforcement - Strong HTTP/API edge inspection capabilities - Scalable
edge identity integration

Limitations: - Protocol diversity and internal locality nuance require
adaptation - Internal heterogeneity persists behind the edge - Deep
containment beyond edge policy requires additional design

Cloudflare compresses perimeter complexity effectively where services
are edge-compatible, but does not inherently normalize enterprise
service diversity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3 Zscaler — Identity Brokerage Model

Zscaler aligns with the brokerage paradigm: identity mediates session
establishment, reducing implicit network trust.

Strengths: - Strong user-to-application identity mediation - Centralized
policy model and clear ZTNA narrative - Reduction of static VPN
dependence

Limitations: - Brokerage validates session start, not necessarily
in-session semantics - Deep transaction inspection requires termination
placement - Assumes higher application maturity for full promise -
Governance workflow remains enterprise responsibility

Zscaler compresses unauthorized session establishment risk strongly, but
unsafe service exposure and containment require mediation layers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.4 F5 — Augmentation and Service Mediation

F5 aligns most closely with augmentation: inserting mediation at the
service boundary to normalize protocols, inject missing controls, and
enable inspection.

Strengths: - Deep protocol termination and inspection flexibility -
Tunable mediation placement (cloud/on-prem) - Strong alignment with
heterogeneous service stacks - Structural support for containment
pathways

Limitations: - Requires architectural discipline and operational
maturity - Governance workflow must still be built or integrated

F5 compresses unsafe service exposure risk most directly and aligns
strongly with the Exposure Governance Plane model when designed
correctly.

======================================================================

5.  Governance and Integration Reality

None of the evaluated vendors deliver a complete Exposure Governance
Plane as a turnkey service. All provide enforcement substrates.

The dominant cost driver is integration and workflow design:

-   Pattern standardization
-   Portal UX and intake governance
-   Identity lifecycle maturity
-   Telemetry normalization
-   Containment policy tuning

Managed service options exist more clearly in some paradigms, but
governance ownership cannot be outsourced entirely. The enterprise must
define the unit of control: the Service Exposure Instance.

======================================================================

6.  Problem vs Vendor Coverage Matrix (Paradigm View)

Risk / Requirement Cisco Cloudflare Zscaler F5

Adjacency control Strong Moderate Weak Moderate Unauthorized session
prevention Moderate Strong Strong Strong Protocol mediation depth Weak
Moderate Weak Strong Transactional validation Weak Moderate Weak Strong
Containment / isolation realism Moderate Moderate Weak Strong
Heterogeneous service fit Moderate Moderate Moderate Strong Governance
workflow provided Partial Partial Partial Partial Integration burden
High High High High

Key takeaway: The differentiator is not access brokerage. The
differentiator is mediation depth and containment realism in
heterogeneous application environments.

======================================================================

7.  Synthesis

There is no universally “best” vendor. Each is coherent within its
paradigm.

The enterprise must first decide which risk domain dominates:

-   If adjacency risk dominates → network enforcement strong.
-   If perimeter complexity dominates → edge abstraction strong.
-   If implicit trust dominates → brokerage strong.
-   If unsafe service behavior dominates → augmentation strong.

Given heterogeneous substrate conditions and explicit containment
expectations, augmentation-aligned architectures most closely match the
Exposure Governance Plane model.

Vendor selection should follow paradigm alignment — not precede it.
