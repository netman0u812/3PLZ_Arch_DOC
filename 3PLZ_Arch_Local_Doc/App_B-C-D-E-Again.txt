Appendix B Identity Brokerage: Governing Admission

Identity brokerage moves enforcement to the session boundary. Before
establishing connectivity to a protected resource, a subject must
authenticate. Policy evaluates attributes associated with that identity.

Technically, brokerage systems operate by:

Intercepting connection attempts

Redirecting unauthenticated sessions to identity providers

Validating credentials via SAML, OIDC, Kerberos, or similar mechanisms

Issuing tokens or session credentials

Forwarding traffic only after successful validation

This model removes implicit trust in network adjacency.

However, its authority primitive is the authenticated subject, not the
transaction within the application.

Consider a broker granting access to an internal web application. The
broker confirms:

The user is authenticated.

The device meets posture requirements.

The session complies with policy.

Once the session is established, the broker becomes largely transparent
unless additional inspection layers are present.

If the application authorizes excessive data access based on internal
role misconfiguration, the broker does not inherently correct it.

Brokerage can be enhanced with contextual signals—geolocation,
behavioral risk scoring, device fingerprinting—but these remain
admission-centric controls.

The distinction is important:

Admission control reduces exposure surface. It does not redefine
application semantics.

Therefore:

Brokerage is evolution beyond topology. It is not replacement for
semantic governance.

Appendix C Abstraction: Governing Delivery

Edge abstraction platforms and service fabrics decouple physical
topology from logical exposure. Services are registered in control
planes. Connectivity is orchestrated through overlay networks. Policies
are centrally defined and distributed.

Technically, abstraction relies on:

Distributed edge nodes

Encrypted overlay tunnels

Centralized policy orchestration

Identity-aware routing constructs

API-driven service registration

This reduces operational complexity. It allows rapid exposure of
services without deep network reconfiguration.

But abstraction assumes that:

The service being exposed is well-defined.

Ownership is clear.

Access requirements are documented.

Lifecycle management exists upstream.

Abstraction simplifies plumbing.

It does not inherently create governance.

When upstream discipline is absent, abstraction accelerates deployment
velocity while preserving ambiguity.

Therefore:

Abstraction is a delivery optimizer. It is not an exposure governance
mechanism.

Appendix D Mediation: Surrogate Transaction Boundaries

Mediation introduces proxy layers that decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt
traffic between exposure domains. This enables enforcement and
observation at a boundary independent of application internals.

Technically, mediation involves:

Terminating TLS connections at controlled proxy nodes

Validating client certificates (mTLS)

Injecting exposure-scoped identity attributes

Logging transaction metadata

Applying content inspection policies

Re-encrypting traffic toward backend systems

Forward proxies govern outbound requests. Reverse proxies govern inbound
requests. SSH and SFTP proxies enforce session-bound identity and
multi-factor controls.

By terminating encrypted sessions, mediation converts opaque traffic
into observable transactions. It enables policy enforcement based on
identity attributes, not merely network attributes.

It does not rewrite application logic. It provides a surrogate
enforcement surface when application logic cannot be modified.

This introduces operational overhead—certificate issuance, revocation,
namespace management—but it transforms exposure from blind routing into
inspectable state.

Therefore:

Mediation is compensatory architecture for brownfield systems. It is not
a substitute for native application security. It is an enforcement
amplifier.

Appendix E Exposure-Scoped Identity and Namespace Authority

General-purpose identity systems authenticate subjects for
organizational participation. Exposure relationships require scoped
authority.

Technically, exposure-scoped authority can be implemented through:

Dedicated certificate hierarchies per exposure domain

Subordinate certificate authorities representing tenants

Unique namespaces (e.g., tenant.example.com)

Proxy certificates tied to those namespaces

User or system certificates embedding exposure identifiers in SAN fields

DNS as authoritative registry for exposure metadata (including TXT
records)

This structure separates workforce identity from exposure identity.

A user authenticated internally does not automatically possess authority
in every exposure domain. Authority must be explicitly granted within
the tenant namespace.

This allows:

Revocation independent of internal directory lifecycle

Clear scoping of exposure privileges

Cryptographic binding of identity to specific transaction surfaces

Independent audit of exposure relationships

DNS becomes more than resolution; it becomes declarative truth.
Certificate chains become more than encryption; they become authority
boundaries.

This model supports governance because it ties identity to declared
exposure objects.

Without scoping, identity drifts. With scoping, authority becomes
bounded.
