Appendix D Mediation and Augmentation Ontology

Mediation and augmentation take a different path.

Rather than eliminate the network or front-load identity exclusively,
mediation inserts an interpretable layer between exposure domains. It
acknowledges that legacy applications cannot be rewritten to embed full
contextual authorization semantics. It acknowledges that network
enforcement cannot interpret transactions. It acknowledges that
brokerage alone cannot see inside the session.

So it introduces a surrogate.

Its primitive is the proxy.

Its authority is certificate-bound identity scoped to the exposure
domain.

Its boundary is namespace.

Mediation does not attempt to remove the network. It overlays identity
into the transport path. It decrypts, inspects, constrains, and
re-encrypts. It creates a surrogate transaction boundary even when the
application cannot.

Why is this necessary?

Because enterprise applications were written under adjacency
assumptions. They lack contextual enforcement depth. They cannot be
easily rewritten. The cost of reconstruction is prohibitive. The
business cannot pause operations for architectural purity.

Mediation therefore acts as a compensatory structure.

It overlays identity where none existed. It constrains transactions
where applications are permissive. It enables inspection where network
enforcement cannot interpret.

Its counterargument is immediate:

Does this not increase complexity?

Yes.

But complexity already exists. Mediation does not create complexity. It
surfaces it.

Another counterargument:

Does this not duplicate identity systems?

It can.

Unless identity is scoped explicitly to exposure domains using
independent certificate hierarchies, namespace binding, and authority
segmentation.

And here we approach the deepest layer.
