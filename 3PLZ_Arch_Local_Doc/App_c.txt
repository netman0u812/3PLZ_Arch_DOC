Edge Abstraction Ontology

Edge abstraction is a different philosophical move.

Where brokerage redefines admission, abstraction redefines the network
itself. It virtualizes adjacency. It dissolves physical topology into
programmable overlays. It treats the enterprise as a collection of
identity-addressable services reachable through a global fabric.

Its primitive is the service endpoint.

Its authority is the control plane.

Its boundary is the abstraction layer itself.

Edge abstraction asks:

Can we eliminate the enterprise network as a concept and replace it with
a globally reachable service fabric?

This is powerful.

It decouples physical infrastructure from logical exposure. It allows
services to exist independently of data center geography. It promises
operational simplicity by collapsing topology into policy.

But again, recursion reveals the limitation.

Abstraction simplifies delivery. It does not inherently impose
governance.

If the underlying service relationships are undefined, abstraction
merely globalizes disorder.

If identity authority is derivative rather than scoped, abstraction
amplifies trust assumptions.

The failure condition of abstraction is not technical. It is
institutional. It assumes that governance exists upstream. It assumes
that service owners understand exposure semantics. It assumes that
identity systems are mature.

Without those, abstraction accelerates entropy.

Its economic appeal is obvious:

Operational outsourcing. Reduced infrastructure management.
Consumption-based scaling.

Its institutional risk is less obvious:

Control plane centralization without exposure governance discipline.

Abstraction can remove friction.

It can also remove friction too early.
