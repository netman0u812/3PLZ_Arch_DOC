Appendix B Identity Brokerage Ontology

Identity brokerage emerges when adjacency ceases to be a reliable trust
signal. Where network enforcement governs flows, brokerage governs
admission. Its primitive is the authenticated session. Its authority is
the identity assertion. Its boundary is the application front door.

At its most basic level, brokerage answers a different question than the
firewall:

May this subject initiate a session with this resource?

This is not trivial progress. It replaces spatial inference with
declarative identity. The subject is authenticated before the connection
is established. The perimeter becomes logical rather than topological.

Why did this model emerge?

Because mobility dissolved physical trust boundaries. Laptops moved.
Remote users became normal. Cloud workloads blurred data center walls.
If location no longer implied trust, something else had to.

Identity filled the vacuum.

But we must be precise here.

Brokerage does not remove the network. It front-loads enforcement into a
transaction boundary. It shifts control from flow establishment to
session establishment.

This distinction matters.

A firewall allows or denies flows based on address, port, and state. A
broker allows or denies sessions based on authenticated identity and
policy.

The broker appears more advanced because it speaks in the language of
users and applications rather than subnets and ports.

But we must ask:

What does it actually know?

And here the first recursive layer emerges.

Most brokerage systems consume identity from existing directories —
Active Directory users, service accounts, machine identities, federated
tokens. They rarely establish a new authority structure for the exposure
use case. Instead, they ride along on existing identity infrastructure.

This introduces a hidden limitation.

If the identity primitive is not purpose-built for the exposure context,
then the broker’s authority is derivative. It authenticates what the
enterprise already defined. It does not redefine identity for exposure
semantics.

Why is this a limitation?

Because enterprise identity systems were not built to model
transaction-specific authority in exposure scenarios. They were built
for workforce authentication. They were built for internal role access.
They were not built to express “this external partner may perform
exactly these bounded actions through this surrogate channel under these
contextual constraints.”

The broker therefore authenticates admission.

It rarely governs transaction semantics.

And this exposes the core contradiction:

Brokerage is transactional at the session boundary, but not necessarily
transactional within the application domain.

Once admitted, the application governs behavior. If the application is
legacy, poorly instrumented, or overly permissive, brokerage cannot
compensate.

Counterargument:

Some will argue that contextual signals — device posture, behavioral
scoring, risk engines — close this gap.

They help.

But they operate at the session envelope. They do not reinterpret
application-level business logic unless that logic is externally
observable and instrumented.

The institutional implication is significant:

Organizations often adopt brokerage believing they have eliminated
network risk. In reality, they have moved enforcement forward but have
not necessarily deepened semantic visibility.

Brokerage is evolution.

It is not transcendence.
