Why Excellence Is Rare in Enterprise Security

The uncomfortable truth is this:

Enterprises do not choose between good and bad architectures.

They choose between constrained paths.

And the constraints are not technical.

They are institutional.

Let’s walk the dialectic gently.

Why don’t enterprises just rebuild applications to be BeyondCorp-native?

Because applications are capital artifacts.

They were built to serve a business function at a point in time under a set of assumptions. The cost of rebuilding them is not the cost of writing code. It is the cost of:

Revalidating business logic

Requalifying regulatory controls

Retraining users

Reintegrating dependent systems

Accepting operational risk during transition

Excellence in application-native zero trust requires:

Context-rich identity plumbing

Transaction-aware authorization

Message-level enforcement

Continuous posture validation

Event-driven risk telemetry

Most enterprise applications were not written with those primitives.

Rewriting them is not evolution.

It is reconstruction.

Enterprises are optimized to avoid reconstruction.

Why not accept brokerage as excellence?

Because brokerage is admission control.

It answers: “May you begin?”

It rarely answers: “May you perform this specific action inside this application under these contextual constraints?”

Brokerage is excellent at eliminating adjacency risk.

It is not inherently excellent at eliminating transaction risk.

So brokerage is progress.

But it is not completeness.

Why not rely purely on network enforcement?

Because network enforcement governs topology.

It can constrain exposure domains.

It cannot interpret intent.

A Palo Alto firewall can decrypt traffic.

But unless the application exposes semantic markers, it is still pattern matching against protocol behavior.

It is still inferring intent from structure.

It is not participating in business logic.

So network enforcement can reduce gross risk.

It cannot express business authorization semantics.

So what is excellence?

Excellence would be:

Applications built with first-class identity authority

Contextual transaction authorization embedded natively

Independent exposure-scoped identity

Transparent governance instrumentation

Formal lifecycle management of exposure relationships

Automated, auditable, self-documenting processes

That is excellence.

But excellence requires greenfield authority.

Most enterprises are brownfield.

The Real Limitation of the Options

Now we make the important move.

Each option is not limited because the vendor is weak.

Each option is limited because of what layer it governs.

Cisco / Palo Alto — govern topology and traffic patterns.
Brokerage platforms — govern admission.
Edge abstraction — governs service delivery.
Augmentation / mediation — governs surrogate transaction boundaries.

None of them rewrite the application.

And unless the application changes, there is a ceiling.

That ceiling is not technical capability.

It is semantic authority.

So Why Accept Less?

Because architecture is not about purity.

It is about trajectory.

The question is not:

“Which solution is perfect?”

The question is:

“Which solution moves us closer to structured, governable, inspectable exposure without collapsing the enterprise?”

Excellence is not binary.

It is asymptotic.

We approach it.

We rarely reach it.
