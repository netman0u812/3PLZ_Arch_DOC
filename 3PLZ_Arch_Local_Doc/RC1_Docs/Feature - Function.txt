A) SSH/SFTP proxy with OTP + key lifecycle

You explicitly deferred this to 1.x.

Deliverables:

SSH bastion/proxy

OTP or SSO gating

ephemeral SSH cert issuance (preferred) + audit



B) HA / horizontal scaling

Your early goal included moving loopbacks and scaling across servers.

Deliverables:

keepalived/anycast/ECMP for loopback /32s

state handling for per-tenant services

consistent BGP behavior during failover



C) Observability + audit completeness

Prometheus metrics (nginx/squid/frr/strongSwan)

per-tenant dashboards

tamper-evident logging / retention




Production Functionality

AAA, IAM, Management and RBAC


2) SAML/OIDC bootstrap (replace OTP)

OTP works for labs; SAML/OIDC is needed for enterprise onboarding.

Deliverables:

IdP config per tenant

assertion validation + group mapping

issuance policy (who can request certs, validity, renewals)


D) Strong policy framework (beyond allow.csv)

Current authz is a good GA baseline; long term you’ll want richer policy.

Deliverables:

groups/roles

time-based rules

upstream claims from SSO

optional OPA/ext_authz integration



8) Security hardening automation

You have hardening appendix docs, but not all scripted.

systemd unit hardening for every service

SELinux policy guidance or enforcement profile

CIS-style checks + drift detection
