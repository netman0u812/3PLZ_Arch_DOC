Hooks Dispatch Model — v1.0.9
=============================

What changed
------------
- Added /opt/gw-builder/run-hooks.sh (dispatcher)
- gwctl calls the dispatcher via run_tenant_hooks() on tenant lifecycle:
    ipsec-up      (after tenant is up)
    tenant-stop   (before tenant is stopped)

Why
---
This explicitly wires module hooks (modules/*.sh) into the tenant lifecycle chain so add-ons
and their guardrails are consistently applied.

Hooks
-----
97-sshproxy-hook.sh
  - Starts/stops external SSH/SFTP reverse proxy add-on (/opt/gw-sshproxy) when SSH_PROXY_MODE=on

98-sshproxy-firewall-hook.sh
  - Applies nftables SSH upstream allow-list guardrail when:
      SSH_PROXY_MODE=on
      SSH_PROXY_UPSTREAM_ALLOWLIST=ip1,ip2,...
  - Recommended:
      SSH_PROXY_EGRESS_IF=eth0   (scopes enforcement safely)
