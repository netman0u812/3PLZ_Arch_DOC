Security Paradigm 1 – Structural Containment
A.1 Conceptual Foundation

Structural containment asserts that isolation must be embedded in topology rather than inferred from policy.

Traditional enterprise networks assume shared adjacency. Segmentation is then layered through firewall rules, ACLs, and filtering policies. This approach treats separation as a configuration artifact rather than a structural property.

Structural containment inverts that assumption.

Isolation becomes the default state.
Adjacency becomes an explicit construction.

The paradigm requires that the absence of mediation equals the absence of reachability.

Containment is not something that can be misconfigured into existence.
It must require deliberate architectural action to create exposure.

A.2 Failure Analysis of Legacy Models

Flat segmentation models fail in predictable ways:

Policy Accretion
As integrations grow, rule sets expand. Over time, rule interactions become opaque. Assurance depends on policy audits rather than architecture.

Route Leakage
Shared routing domains allow prefix propagation errors to create unintended adjacency.

Shared Failure Domains
When tenants share forwarding planes, compromise or misconfiguration in one domain can affect another.

Administrative Error Sensitivity
Minor mistakes can produce cross-domain exposure.

The failure is not that firewalls are ineffective.
The failure is that policy over shared adjacency scales poorly.

A.3 Structural Requirements

Structural containment requires:

Per-tenant routing domains.

Per-tenant forwarding contexts.

No shared adjacency planes.

Explicit mediation constructs to bridge domains.

Deterministic route import/export filtering.

Containment must survive:

Tenant count growth.

Policy growth.

Operator variability.

Infrastructure scaling.

RC1 demonstrated that isolation can be architectural rather than policy-dependent.
