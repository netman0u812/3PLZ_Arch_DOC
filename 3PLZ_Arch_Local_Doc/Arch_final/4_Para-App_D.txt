Appendix D
Security Paradigm 4 – Deterministic Lifecycle Governance
D.1 Conceptual Foundation

Security failures accumulate over time.

Provisioning is engineered.
Removal is neglected.

Lifecycle asymmetry is the primary driver of exposure sprawl.

Reversibility must be treated as a security primitive.

D.2 Failure Analysis of Legacy Models

Common failure modes include:

Orphaned tunnels.

Residual firewall rules.

Stale route advertisements.

Dormant but reachable vendor connections.

No deterministic teardown mechanism.

Exposure persists because removal is operationally risky.

D.3 Structural Requirements

Lifecycle governance requires:

Declarative configuration state.

Idempotent provisioning.

Deterministic teardown.

Expiration enforcement.

Renewal reauthorization.

Audit logging of lifecycle transitions.

D.4 Invariants

Invariant D1: Provisioning must be idempotent.

Invariant D2: Removal must eliminate all routing, mediation, identity, and inspection constructs.

Invariant D3: Exposure must not persist beyond declared lifecycle without reauthorization.

Invariant D4: Lifecycle state must be auditable and reconstructable from system state.

D.5 Implementation Characteristics

Declarative configuration files

State reconciliation engines

Teardown scripts

Tenant-specific config isolation

Expiration timers

Audit event logging

D.6 Validation Criteria

An implementation satisfies Deterministic Lifecycle Governance if:

Deleting a Tenant removes all artifacts.

Re-creating a Tenant produces identical deterministic state.

Expired Tenants automatically suspend.

Lifecycle logs match system state.

D.7 RC1 Validation

RC1 implemented idempotent provisioning and deterministic teardown routines.

Tenant removal removed:

Tunnels

Routing entries

Mediation proxies

Identity artifacts

Inspection hooks

This demonstrated reversibility as structural reality, not aspiration.
