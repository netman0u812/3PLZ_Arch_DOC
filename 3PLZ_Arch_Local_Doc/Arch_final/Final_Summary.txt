Modern enterprises rely on persistent third-party connectivity to enable
digital collaboration, vendor integration, SaaS adoption, and ecosystem
participation. Over time, these connections accumulate as a natural
byproduct of growth. Each is created to serve a legitimate business
objective. However, governance mechanisms have not evolved at the same
pace as expansion.

The result is a structural asymmetry in which connectivity persists
beyond its original context, ownership becomes unclear, and lifecycle
review is inconsistent. Third-party connections represent ongoing trust
boundaries between independent control domains. While they deliver
operational value, they also introduce risk. Without defined
accountability and structured lifecycle management, exposure becomes
difficult to evaluate and retire.

This document proposes a governance-aligned operating model that
restores symmetry without constraining agility.

The model begins by redefining third-party connectivity as a
business-owned exposure domain rather than a technical artifact.
Accountability resides with the function that derives value from the
connection. Ownership aligns risk with benefit realization.

Each relationship is formalized as a Tenant, a governance construct
linking connectivity to enterprise inventories, vendor records, and
accountable stakeholders. Connectivity cannot exist without declared
sponsorship and traceability.

Delivery is enabled through a standardized Service Catalog of approved
connectivity capabilities. Business stakeholders select structured
patterns aligned to their needs rather than designing bespoke
infrastructure. Embedded controls ensure compliance, inspection, and
segmentation are consistently enforced.

An abstracted, automated self-service portal orchestrates the workflow.
It captures business intent, enforces governance validation, and
triggers standardized technical provisioning through automation.
Lifecycle controls require periodic re-attestation, ensuring exposure
persists only as long as business value justifies its risk.

Through this approach, the enterprise preserves the agility required for
modern collaboration while embedding structural accountability into
every third-party interaction. Connectivity transitions from unmanaged
accumulation to governed business capability.
