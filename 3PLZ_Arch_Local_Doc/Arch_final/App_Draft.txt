Appendix A – Structural Isolation: Failure Modes and Functional
Invariants A.1 Why Flat Segmentation Fails at Scale

Traditional enterprise network design assumes shared adjacency with
segmentation enforced through policy. VLANs, VRFs, firewall rule sets,
and ACLs are layered over a common routing substrate. In small-scale
environments, this model is manageable. At enterprise scale with dozens
or hundreds of third-party integrations, it becomes structurally
fragile.

Flat adjacency architectures fail for three primary reasons:

Policy Complexity Grows Faster Than Assurance Each new integration adds
rules. Each exception adds conditional logic. Over time, firewall
policies become asymmetric, overlapping, and difficult to reason about.
Assurance becomes dependent on configuration review rather than
architectural containment.

Route Inheritance Becomes Implicit When routing domains are shared,
route import/export rules become a source of adjacency leakage. Even
minor configuration drift can introduce unintended reachability.

Blast Radius Expands With Density When tenants coexist within shared
adjacency domains, compromise of one tenant can potentially expose
lateral paths into others, especially where shared inspection or routing
planes exist.

The core issue is this: segmentation implemented through filtering over
shared adjacency is probabilistic at scale.

Structural containment must replace policy-dependent separation.

A.2 Structural Isolation as an Architectural Invariant

Structural isolation requires that:

Each Tenant exists within a discrete forwarding and routing context.

No Tenant inherits adjacency to another by default.

Internal enterprise networks are not reachable without explicit
mediation constructs.

Route propagation boundaries are deterministic and constrained.

The isolation invariant can be stated precisely:

If no mediation construct exists between Tenant A and Tenant B, then no
packet originating in A can reach B.

This must hold regardless of:

Number of tenants.

Policy volume.

Operator variability.

Routing table scale.

Isolation must be topology-enforced, not policy-hoped.

A.3 Validation Criteria

An implementation satisfies structural isolation if:

Removal of mediation constructs immediately eliminates reachability.

No shared routing context exists where tenants can observe each other’s
routes.

Administrative error in one tenant cannot introduce adjacency to
another.

Packet capture within one tenant cannot observe traffic belonging to
another.

Structural containment is the foundation upon which all other domains
depend.

Appendix B – Transport: Encryption Without Trust Expansion B.1 The
Conflation Problem

Historically, enterprises equated secure tunnels with secure exposure.
An IPsec tunnel or VPN connection was treated as sufficient proof of
control. In practice, tunnels become durable routing conduits. Over
time:

Additional routes are advertised.

Additional firewall exceptions are granted.

Scope drifts incrementally.

Encryption protects data in transit. It does not constrain reachability.

When transport and authorization are conflated, scope expands without
architectural review.

B.2 Transport as a Subordinate Capability

In the governed exposure model:

Transport is bound to Tenant context.

Route advertisement is constrained to declared service endpoints.

Transport establishment does not automatically populate routing tables.

Tunnel teardown removes adjacency completely.

The invariant is:

Transport enables communication but does not define what is reachable.

Authorization is defined exclusively by mediation constructs.

B.3 Failure Modes Prevented

By decoupling transport from scope:

Unauthorized route expansion is prevented.

Encryption cannot silently expand adjacency.

Tunnel reuse across tenants is disallowed.

Residual routing state cannot persist after teardown.

B.4 Validation Criteria

An implementation satisfies transport discipline if:

Establishing transport alone does not produce end-to-end reachability.

Declared endpoints are enforced at routing boundaries.

Removal of transport eliminates adjacency deterministically.

Route advertisements are filtered to allow-listed prefixes.

Transport is necessary infrastructure. It must never define trust.

Appendix C – Mediation and Identity: From Address Reachability to
Capability Control C.1 Network Adjacency as a Coarse Control Model

IP-based reachability is inherently broad. Once a subnet is reachable,
every host within it becomes a potential interaction surface unless
filtered at higher layers.

This model fails under:

Lateral movement scenarios.

Application sprawl within internal networks.

Vendor compromise events.

Reachability is not capability.

C.2 Mediation as the Enforcement Core

All third-party interaction must traverse mediation constructs that:

Terminate sessions or proxy connections.

Enforce explicit allow-lists.

Constrain protocol semantics.

Restrict directionality.

Mediation replaces direct routing with capability enforcement.

The invariant:

External actors may access only declared capabilities, not network
segments.

C.3 Identity Binding

Where protocols allow, identity must be cryptographically verified and
bound to the Tenant context.

Identity enforcement ensures:

Actor-level accountability.

Revocation capability independent of network topology.

Traceability aligned to business ownership.

Without identity binding, exposure remains tied to location rather than
subject.

C.4 Failure Modes Prevented

Lateral exploration within internal subnets.

Credential replay across tenants.

Implicit trust based solely on source IP.

Vendor compromise leading to unrestricted reach.

C.5 Validation Criteria

An implementation satisfies mediation and identity invariants if:

Direct routed access to internal subnets is impossible.

All permitted flows traverse enforcement constructs.

Identity validation failures result in denial.

Audit logs associate identity with capability invocation.

Mediation is the core of exposure control.

Appendix D – Deterministic Visibility and Inspection Architecture D.1
The Problem With Perimeter Inspection

Perimeter inspection centralizes visibility but lacks context. It sees
transport flows, not mediated capabilities. Distributed logging lacks
consistency and correlation.

Inspection without structural attachment points produces blind spots.

D.2 Deterministic Inspection Points

Inspection must occur at defined locations within Tenant boundaries.
These points must:

Mirror traffic without altering routing semantics.

Log mediation decisions.

Preserve isolation boundaries.

Support export to enterprise analysis systems.

The invariant:

Visibility must not alter exposure semantics.

D.3 Failure Modes Prevented

Undetected lateral movement within tenant scope.

Inspection bypass via alternate routes.

Loss of audit trace due to distributed logging inconsistencies.

D.4 Validation Criteria

An implementation satisfies visibility invariants if:

Inspection can be enabled per Tenant without topology redesign.

Logging reflects mediation and identity outcomes.

Mirrored traffic cannot escape containment domains.

Disabling inspection does not alter routing behavior.

Inspection strengthens assurance without expanding exposure.

Appendix E – Lifecycle Enforcement and Reversibility E.1 Accumulation as
the Historical Failure Mode

Provisioning is engineered. Decommissioning is avoided. Over years,
exposure domains persist without active justification.

Residual connectivity becomes latent risk.

E.2 Reversibility as Structural Discipline

The architecture must enforce:

Idempotent provisioning from authoritative state.

Deterministic teardown removing all constructs.

Suspension capability without partial dismantling.

Renewal requiring explicit reauthorization.

The invariant:

Exposure persists only while declared.

E.3 Failure Modes Prevented

Orphaned tunnels.

Residual firewall rules.

Undocumented route propagation.

Persistent trust after business termination.

E.4 Validation Criteria

An implementation satisfies lifecycle invariants if:

Complete removal of a Tenant eliminates all routing and mediation
constructs.

Re-creation produces identical deterministic state.

Audit logs reflect lifecycle transitions.

Expiration without renewal results in enforced suspension.

Reversibility prevents systemic entropy.

Appendix F – Extensibility Without Erosion F.1 The Extension Risk

New protocols, inspection modules, and mediation types will be
introduced over time. Without guardrails, these additions can bypass
containment layers.

F.2 Guardrail-Enforced Extension Model

Extensions must:

Integrate through Tenant lifecycle hooks.

Inherit isolation and identity semantics.

Respect routing containment.

Avoid bypassing mediation constructs.

The invariant:

No extension may operate outside Tenant structural context.

F.3 Validation Criteria

Adding an extension cannot create new adjacency outside declared scope.

Removal of extension restores baseline state.

Extensions cannot modify global routing contexts.

Extensibility must preserve invariants.

Appendix G – Administrative Separation and Operational Sustainability
G.1 Control Plane Segregation

Administrative and orchestration planes must be isolated from Tenant
data planes. Tenant compromise must not enable platform compromise.

G.2 Capacity Governance

Resource monitoring must inform Tenant placement. Oversubscription must
not degrade containment guarantees.

The invariant:

Governance enforcement must remain stable under scale.

G.3 Validation Criteria

Administrative interfaces are unreachable from Tenant domains.

Resource thresholds prevent uncontrolled Tenant instantiation.

Control-plane failure does not collapse data-plane isolation.

Operational stability is part of exposure governance.
