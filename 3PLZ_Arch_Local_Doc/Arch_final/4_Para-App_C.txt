Appendix C Security Paradigm 3 – Identity-Bound Authorization C.1
Conceptual Foundation

Location-based trust is fragile.

IP addresses represent network position, not actor identity.

In distributed ecosystems, identity must anchor trust.

Authorization decisions must bind to authenticated subjects, not merely
source networks.

C.2 Failure Analysis of Legacy Models

Location-based authorization fails when:

IPs are reused.

Vendors share infrastructure.

NAT obscures origin.

Credentials are reused across contexts.

VPN presence implies blanket trust.

IP address ≠ identity.

C.3 Structural Requirements

Identity-bound authorization requires:

Cryptographic identity validation.

Tenant-scoped trust anchors.

Identity-to-capability mapping.

Revocation independent of routing changes.

C.4 Invariants

Invariant C1: Access must be denied in the absence of validated
identity.

Invariant C2: Identity scope must be limited to the Tenant context.

Invariant C3: Identity revocation must not require topology change.

C.5 Implementation Characteristics

mTLS enforcement

Certificate-based authentication

Per-tenant CAs

Identity binding at mediation layer

Identity-aware logging

C.6 Validation Criteria

An implementation satisfies Identity-Bound Authorization if:

Identity validation failures block access even when transport exists.

Identity context is tenant-scoped.

Revocation prevents further capability access immediately.

Audit logs bind subject identity to capability invocation.

C.7 RC1 Validation

RC1 implemented per-tenant mTLS enforcement and identity validation at
mediation layers.

This proved identity can be tenant-scoped and bound to capability
access.
