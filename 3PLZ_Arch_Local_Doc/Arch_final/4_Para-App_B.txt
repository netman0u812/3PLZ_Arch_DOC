Appendix B Security Paradigm 2 – Mediated Capability Exposure B.1
Conceptual Foundation

Network adjacency is coarse.

Once a subnet is reachable, every host in that subnet becomes
potentially reachable unless further constrained.

Mediated capability exposure replaces subnet adjacency with service
adjacency.

External actors do not receive network reachability. They receive access
to explicitly declared capabilities.

B.2 Failure Analysis of Legacy Models

Legacy VPN models grant network extension.

Common failure modes include:

Lateral exploration inside internal networks.

Expansion of allowed ports over time.

Overbroad firewall rules to “make it work.”

Implicit trust of all hosts within reachable subnets.

Encryption does not reduce blast radius. It only protects data in
transit.

B.3 Structural Requirements

Mediation requires:

Proxy or enforcement layers between tenants and internal systems.

Explicit allow-lists of endpoints.

Directional enforcement.

Protocol constraint enforcement.

Prevention of arbitrary subnet exposure.

B.4 Invariants

Invariant B1: No Tenant may access internal subnets directly.

Invariant B2: All permitted flows must traverse mediation constructs.

Invariant B3: Destination scope must be explicitly declared and
enforced.

Invariant B4: Directionality must be explicitly constrained.

B.5 Implementation Characteristics

Common technical realizations include:

Proxy-to-proxy architectures.

Application-layer mediation.

Layer-7 enforcement.

Destination allow-lists.

No direct route export to internal subnets.

The architecture must ensure that mediation is unavoidable.

B.6 Validation Criteria

An implementation satisfies Mediated Capability Exposure if:

No direct routed path exists from Tenant to internal subnet.

All flows pass through enforcement points.

Removing mediation constructs eliminates capability access.

Adding new capability requires explicit configuration.

B.7 RC1 Validation

RC1 implemented a dual-proxy mediation model:

Tier-1 tenant ingress.

Tier-2 internal mediation.

No direct subnet adjacency.

This demonstrated that network adjacency can be replaced with capability
mediation at scale.
