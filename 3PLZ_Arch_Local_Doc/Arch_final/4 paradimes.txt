1. Structural Containment (Isolation as Topology)

Security is enforced by structure, not policy layering.

Isolation is embedded in routing and forwarding context.

Tenants do not share adjacency domains.

Absence of mediation equals absence of reachability.

Containment survives operator error and scale.

This is the shift away from flat network + firewall rules toward structural segmentation.

This paradigm answers:
“How do we prevent implicit trust propagation?”

2. Mediated Capability Exposure (Adjacency → Capability)

Security is enforced by mediation, not subnet reachability.

No direct routed exposure of internal networks.

All flows pass through enforcement constructs.

Destination scope is allow-listed.

Directionality is enforced.

Protocol semantics are constrained.

This is the shift from network adjacency to capability adjacency.

This paradigm answers:
“How do we reduce blast radius even if transport is secure?”

3. Identity-Bound Authorization (Trust Anchored in Identity)

Security is enforced at the subject level, not location level.

Identity is cryptographically validated.

Identity is tenant-scoped.

Access is bound to declared capability.

Revocation is independent of routing topology.

This is the shift away from “source IP = trust” thinking.

This paradigm answers:
“How do we ensure accountability and revocability?”

4. Deterministic Lifecycle Governance (Reversibility as Control)

Security is enforced over time, not just at creation.

Provisioning is declarative.

Removal is deterministic.

No residual artifacts.

Expiration requires renewal.

Extensions inherit containment.

This is the shift from static integration to managed exposure.

This paradigm answers:
“How do we prevent accumulation from becoming systemic risk?”
