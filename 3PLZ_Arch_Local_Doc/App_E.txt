Appendix E Identity as Authority and Exposure-Scoped Trust Domains

Identity is often treated as a directory attribute. This is a category
error.

Identity, in the context of exposure governance, is authority.

Authority must be scoped.

Authority must be bound.

Authority must be verifiable independent of application context.

When identity is consumed from a general directory without scoping, it
inherits all the ambiguities of that directory.

When identity is established via certificate hierarchies scoped to
tenant domains, authority becomes contextual.

For example:

tenant_id.3plz.com as namespace Subordinate CA per tenant Forward proxy
certificate fp.tenant_id.3plz.com Reverse proxy certificate
rpX.tenant_id.3plz.com User certificates bound to email identity in SAN
DNS as authoritative namespace and metadata plane

This is not aesthetic design.

It is authority segmentation.

The certificate becomes something the user has. The namespace becomes
something the tenant owns. The proxy becomes a transaction surrogate.

Now exposure can be governed without modifying the legacy application.

This is not perfect identity maturity.

It is exposure-scoped authority.

And that distinction matters.
