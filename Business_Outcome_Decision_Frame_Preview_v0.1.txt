BUSINESS OUTCOME DECISION SUMMARY (Doc 3 Preview)
Exposure Governance Plane Program

Purpose

This document provides an outcome-driven decision frame for enterprise leadership.
It does not assert that one vendor is universally “right” or “wrong.”
Instead, it clarifies that each solution paradigm produces different business outcomes,
requires different levels of governance maturity, and compresses different risk domains.

The decision is therefore not a technology decision first.
It is an outcome and operating-model decision.

======================================================================

1. The Core Enterprise Question

The enterprise is not choosing between four products.
It is choosing between four enforcement philosophies:

- Network Enforcement
- Edge Abstraction
- Identity Brokerage
- Service Augmentation

Each is coherent.
Each produces different outcomes.
Each imposes different governance burdens.

======================================================================

2. Outcome-Driven Recommendation Frame

If the business outcome is:

A) “Stabilize and reduce adjacency risk with minimal disruption”
→ Choose Network Enforcement (Cisco-style)

Outcome:
- Strong segmentation and blast-radius reduction
- Incremental modernization
- Lower disruption, slower governance transformation

Residual risk:
- Limited transaction mediation depth
- Unsafe service exposure risk persists without augmentation

----------------------------------------------------------------------

B) “Establish strong identity-based session control quickly”
→ Choose Identity Brokerage (Zscaler-style)

Outcome:
- Reduced implicit trust and VPN dependence
- Centralized access policy enforcement

Residual risk:
- Session brokerage does not equal transaction validation
- Deep protocol containment requires additional mediation layers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

C) “Reposition perimeter enforcement to a unified global edge fabric”
→ Choose Edge Abstraction (Cloudflare-style)

Outcome:
- Simplified Internet-facing policy boundary
- Strong HTTP/API edge inspection
- Platform migration opportunity

Residual risk:
- Governance discipline still required
- Internal heterogeneity persists behind edge
- New operational dependency introduced

----------------------------------------------------------------------

D) “Impose governed service mediation and containment over heterogeneous estates”
→ Choose Service Augmentation + Exposure Governance Plane (RC1/F5-style)

Outcome:
- Protocol-aware mediation and inspection
- Strong containment and transactional validation overlays
- Direct compression of unsafe service exposure risk
- Forces operational governance maturity

Residual risk:
- Requires architectural discipline and portal-driven workflow ownership
- Higher design responsibility, but highest structural correction

======================================================================

3. Business Decision Synthesis

The correct selection depends on what leadership wants to achieve:

- Comfort and stability?
- Rapid session brokerage modernization?
- Strategic edge platform migration?
- Structural governance correction and containment depth?

All options require governance work.
The difference is whether governance is treated as incremental,
relocated, or made foundational.

Vendor selection should follow paradigm alignment —
not precede it.
