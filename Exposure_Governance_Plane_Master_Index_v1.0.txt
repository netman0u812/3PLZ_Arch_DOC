MASTER INDEX OF IDEAS, MODELS, AND FRAMEWORKS Exposure Governance Plane
Program Version 1.0 (Session Consolidation)

====================================================================== 1.
Core Problem Shift: Connectivity → Governance

Initial framing: “Find a product to fix third‑party access.” Refined
understanding: Third‑party access is not a network problem first — it is
a governance problem with technical symptoms.

Key deficiencies identified: - No authoritative inventory - No named
ownership - No lifecycle enforcement - No standardized service
definition - No containment model - No durable evidence model

======================================================================
2. The Exposure Governance Plane (Primary Concept)

Definition: A durable service mediation layer paired with a governance
control plane that overlays identity binding, inspection, containment,
lifecycle control, and telemetry normalization around existing
enterprise applications.

Shift in thinking: From tunnels and firewall rules → to governed service
exposure.

======================================================================
3. ZTNA as an Evolutionary Journey

Zero Trust is a direction, not a product. Identity‑native architectures
assume application maturity that is uneven across enterprise estates.

Gap identified: Leadership expectations (validate every transaction) vs
Application maturity reality (limited identity propagation and
telemetry).

Core insight: The challenge is not intent — it is feasibility.

======================================================================
4. Brokerage vs Augmentation

Brokerage: - Identity-mediated access - Compresses unauthorized session
establishment risk

Augmentation: - Service mediation + protocol normalization - Compresses
unsafe service exposure risk

Key principle: Authorization is necessary but insufficient when
applications cannot enforce policy themselves.

======================================================================
5. Authorization vs Transaction Validation

Session authorization answers: “Should this identity connect?”

Transactional validation answers: “Is this session behaving within
expected bounds?”

Validation requires: - Termination - Semantic protocol understanding -
Identity continuity - Behavioral baseline - Runtime containment

Principle: If you do not terminate and understand the protocol, you are
not validating transactions — you are validating login.

======================================================================
6. Containment & Isolation

Containment ladder defined: 1. Alert 2. Rate limit 3. Session
termination 4. Redirect to inspection pool 5. Tenant quarantine

Principle: Detection without containment shifts risk to response time.

======================================================================
7. Enterprise Substrate Reality

Observed heterogeneity: - Multiple SFTP implementations - Multiple WAF
stacks - Mixed cloud/on‑prem patterns - SaaS + internal file sharing -
VDI coexistence - Internal → third‑party flows

Implication: There is no single architecture to secure — only patterns
to govern.

======================================================================
8. Service Exposure Instance (Atomic Unit)

Pattern + Tenant + Owner + Lifecycle + Evidence

Shift: Unit of control is a service exposure instance, not a tunnel or
firewall rule.

======================================================================
9. Portal as Command-and-Control

Plane separation model: - Governance / Control Plane (Portal) -
Allocation Plane (net_alloc) - Implementation Plane (net-imp)

Benefits: - Deterministic automation - Separation of duties - Replayable
evidence

======================================================================
10. Governance as the Real Product

Vendors provide enforcement substrates. Enterprise must design: -
Workflow - Refusal criteria - Evidence model - Lifecycle control -
Standardized patterns

======================================================================
11. Refusal Authority

YES requires consensus. NO requires a standard.

Refusal triggers: - No owner - No expiry - No logging - Generic identity
without justification

======================================================================
12. Identity Maturity Model

Level 0 – Network trust Level 1 – User identity Level 2 – User + device
context Level 3 – Workload identity Level 4 – Contextual transaction
authorization Level 5 – Continuous adaptive containment

Observation: Most enterprises operate between Levels 1–3.

======================================================================
13. RC1 as Proof-of-Implementability

Purpose of RC1: - Validate theory - Model cost - Enable vendor
evaluation - Demonstrate feasibility

Principle: If theory cannot be implemented, vendor claims cannot be
evaluated.

======================================================================
14. Vendor Paradigm Lens

Cisco – Network enforcement + managed integration Cloudflare – Edge
abstraction Zscaler – Brokerage F5 – Augmentation

Insight: Vendors are coherent within paradigms, not interchangeable
feature sets.

======================================================================
15. Self‑Service Reality

Self‑service requires: - Full UX definition - Deterministic automation -
Governance metadata - Clear refusal criteria

Without workflow, “self‑service” is marketing.

======================================================================
16. Business Value Framing

Exposure Governance delivers: - Structured ownership - Risk inventory -
Audit evidence - Transaction visibility - Incident containment
leverage - Standardization-driven cost control

======================================================================
17. Matrices Developed

Matrix 1 – Enforcement Paradigm Comparison Matrix 2 – Risk Domain
Compression Matrix Matrix 3 – Governance Intake + Evidence Model Matrix
4 – Identity Maturity Progression Matrix 5 – Transaction Validation &
Containment Ladder Matrix 6 – Vendor Alignment Against Paradigms

======================================================================
18. Open Expansion Areas

-   Operational cost modeling
-   Decommission lifecycle enforcement
-   Residual risk ownership model
-   Renewal/attestation cycles
