VENDOR SOLUTION ANALYSIS DOCUMENT (v0.1) Mapping Vendor Offerings to the
Exposure Governance Plane

Purpose

This document evaluates vendor responses through the architectural lens
established in the Exposure Governance Plane paper. The goal is not to
score features. The goal is to assess paradigm alignment, transactional
validation capability, containment realism, governance integration, and
operational sustainability in heterogeneous enterprise environments.

This analysis is vendor-neutral and paradigm-driven.

====================================================================== 1.
Evaluation Framework

Each vendor is evaluated across five dimensions:

1)  Enforcement Paradigm Alignment
2)  Transaction Validation Depth
3)  Containment & Isolation Capability
4)  Governance & Workflow Integration
5)  Operational & Integration Burden

The central question is not “which product has more features?” The
question is:

Which paradigm best compresses the enterprise’s dominant risk domains
while remaining operationally feasible?

======================================================================
2. Cisco — Network Enforcement + Managed Integration

Paradigm Alignment: Cisco’s posture centers on network enforcement and
segmentation, augmented by identity signals and optionally delivered via
managed service. This model excels at adjacency control and blast-radius
reduction.

Strengths: - Deterministic segmentation - Mature routing & control-plane
expertise - Managed service option reduces internal staffing burden -
Strong integration into traditional enterprise substrate

Limitations (relative to Exposure Governance model): - Network
enforcement does not inherently mediate protocol semantics - Transaction
validation depth depends on additional layers - Containment beyond
session termination requires integration effort - Governance workflow
must be designed externally

Assessment: Cisco compresses unauthorized access risk and adjacency risk
effectively. It is less structurally aligned to unsafe service exposure
risk unless paired with additional mediation layers.

======================================================================
3. Cloudflare — Edge Abstraction Model

Paradigm Alignment: Cloudflare represents edge abstraction. Enforcement
is shifted outward to a globally distributed edge fabric.

Strengths: - Consolidated global ingress - Strong HTTP/API edge
inspection - Scalable identity enforcement at edge - Simplified
perimeter footprint

Limitations: - Non-HTTP protocol nuance may require adaptation -
Internal heterogeneity still exists behind edge - Governance workflow
remains external responsibility - Deep containment may require
additional design

Assessment: Cloudflare compresses perimeter complexity and
Internet-facing risk effectively. It is strongest where services are
edge-compatible and uniform. It does not inherently normalize internal
heterogeneity.

======================================================================
4. Zscaler — Identity Brokerage Model

Paradigm Alignment: Zscaler operates primarily as a brokerage model.
Identity mediates session establishment, reducing implicit network
trust.

Strengths: - Strong user-to-application identity mediation - Reduced
reliance on static VPN constructs - Centralized policy model - Clear
Zero Trust narrative alignment

Limitations: - Brokerage validates session start, not necessarily
in-session semantics - Deep transaction inspection requires termination
placement - Assumes higher application maturity in some scenarios -
Governance workflow remains enterprise responsibility

Assessment: Zscaler excels at compressing unauthorized session
establishment risk. It is less structurally aligned to unsafe service
exposure risk unless paired with mediation and inspection layers.

======================================================================
5. F5 — Augmentation & Service Mediation

Paradigm Alignment: F5 aligns most closely with augmentation. It
introduces mediation at the service boundary, normalizing protocols and
enabling inspection.

Strengths: - Deep protocol termination & inspection capabilities -
Flexible mediation placement (cloud/on-prem) - Tunable traffic shaping
and inspection chains - Well aligned with heterogeneous service stacks

Limitations: - Requires architectural design discipline - Governance
workflow must be built - Operational maturity required for
sustainability

Assessment: F5 compresses unsafe service exposure risk and supports
transactional validation semantics when designed properly. It places
greater design responsibility on the enterprise but aligns strongly with
the Exposure Governance Plane model.

======================================================================
6. Containment Realism Comparison

Network Enforcement: Strong at adjacency reduction, limited at
in-session containment.

Edge Abstraction: Strong at perimeter isolation, variable at deep
protocol containment.

Brokerage: Strong at session control, weaker at transaction semantics
without mediation.

Augmentation: Strongest at tunable containment and protocol-aware
enforcement.

======================================================================
7. Governance & Workflow Considerations

None of the evaluated vendors inherently deliver a fully realized
Exposure Governance Plane. All provide enforcement substrates.
Governance, intake workflow, refusal criteria, lifecycle enforcement,
and evidence retention must be architected at the enterprise level or
delivered via an integrator.

Cisco and F5 offer clearer managed service alternatives. Cloudflare and
Zscaler models assume more direct enterprise integration ownership,
though partners may fill that role.

======================================================================
8. Integration & Operational Burden

The dominant cost driver across all paradigms is integration, not
licensing.

Key drivers: - Pattern standardization - Portal UX & workflow design -
Identity integration maturity - Telemetry normalization - Containment
policy tuning

RC1 demonstrated that proof-of-implementability is essential before
vendor scoping is credible.

======================================================================
9. Synthesis

There is no universally “best” vendor. Each is coherent within its
paradigm.

The enterprise must first decide: Which risk domain is dominant?

-   If adjacency risk dominates → network enforcement strong.
-   If perimeter complexity dominates → edge abstraction strong.
-   If implicit trust dominates → brokerage strong.
-   If unsafe service behavior dominates → augmentation strong.

Given heterogeneous substrate conditions and CISO-driven transactional
containment requirements, augmentation-aligned architectures most
closely match the Exposure Governance model.

Final Note:

Vendor selection should follow paradigm alignment — not precede it.
